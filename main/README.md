# DATA1200-Home-exam

Home exam, assignment text
 

You are expected to do this home exam in groups of 3 to 5 students, as per the "Course descriptionLinks to an external site.".
Create groups on InsperaLinks to an external site.
Upload the site as a Zipped file (minimum)
Optional: Send link to GitHub/ GitHub pages as well
Language: Any Scandinavian language or English
You are expected to use HTML5 & CSS3; no JavaScript (or other languages, libraries or external sources) should be necessary
 

OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:
Create this site in GitHub and publish on GitHub Pages.
Submit a link to the GitHub Pages site as text on Inspera in addition to the Zip-file
 

Create a website with 4 or 5 pages
Theme: OsloMet Campus in general or Pilestredet 35 in particular
index.html should have a general introduction with at least one relevant image
One page must be "Accessibility" — see below
One page must be "Topical" — see below
The remaining (1 or 2) pages should have images and headings presenting a place or an aspect of the campus/ building, e.g. a canteen; the text may be "dummy text" — see below
All pages but one must share the same visual design
You may choose which (if any) one page should have a different design
Comment your code
Any semantic element deserves a super-short comment on what it is
Any CSS selector (in the CSS, not when used in HTML) deserves a comment, at least a descriptor
Any code that is used in scaling or responsive to screen-size deserves a comment
The main purpose for the comments should be to help a future developer take over your project and develop it further; for me, it helps weed out the most obvious copied-code-without-understanding issues
Compulsory pages in site:
Accessibility-page
Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text (about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. Tell us how you checked, and coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an automated test could tell you. You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code – lack of images may affect your score.

Topical-page
Copy a short text (anywhere from 300 to 1000 words) from DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers or other subject you have completed. (Or write a new, short text.)

Add images (if there are none). Remember that in Norwegian copyright law, photographer must always be included. (May be organisation, e.g."Photo: Scanpix", can be in the code, hence invisible on the page itself.)

Add headings (if there are none).

Add links (if there are none). This text should have multiple links to external sites with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

If you wish to show off some skills, but found that difficult with the other pages, you can make this (or another) page different from the others, with a distinct visual of functional identity.

Dummy texts
Apart from the pages "Accessibility" and "Topical", you may use a Lorem-ipsum text. We shall not read the other texts, but we shall look for relevant and correct use of headings, links and <picture>/ <img> with alt-text. This is often easier to do correctly with actual texts than dummy-text. Even in a dummy-text, you should use real headings, like <h1>Study areas in P35</h1>…<h2>The library</h2>.

Copying code
You should always cite in a comment where you have code from, if it is from a particular place. For example:
<!-- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_picture.aspLinks to an external site. --> or /* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/GridsLinks to an external site. */

However, in most circumstances we shall not expect you to cite those two sites, as this is considered "general knowledge". And even if you do reuse code from these sites, you get full score for using the code correctly.

On the other hand, if you use more special code from sites like CodePen.io, you should always cite it. Furthermore, if you use the code as-is, i.e. don't make it your own through modification or application, you may not get any points from it.
/* https://codepen.io/Wandersonsc/pen/RMerRy */ In fact, you may lose points if you copy code without citing it or if you seem to not understand how it should be applied.

Using code suggested by an AI is highly risky! LLM AIs like ChatGPT reuse code from existing sites, but a) may not cite the correct sources, b) sometimes makes mistakes, and c) even when it doesn't make mistakes, it can be a mix-and-match that lacks consistency. Therefor: Don't use AI, please! (GitHub Copilot is better, but not without issues.)

Using images
Always have photographer-name (or company) and source. (Both or any can be visible, both or any can be hidden in a comment.) In Norway, the photo must always be credited. For example inside the text that accompany the imageLinks to an external site..

Illustration photo, with photographer name and rights-holder name in byline.

The size of any photo should never be bigger than 1 MB

Grading:

Grading sheet for examiners DATA1200
Last updated 2023 | As assignments change from year to year, the use of grading sheets may need to be calibrated by 
the sensors for optimal alignment in any given year.
Course is graded on the scale A—F using the following indicators to calculate the grade.
DATA1200 is a 5 ECTS, first semester introduction course, and all hand-ins are assumed to be in groups 
of 3–5 students. HTML and CSS must follow standards. Copied/ re-used code from external sources is 
allowed as long as source is cited; however, points are only awarded when copied code is clearly 
understood – else it may be ignored for scoring. JavaScript does not provide extra points but may reduce a 
score if badly written/ incorporated JS breaks the page. A score may be reduced to 0.
Pages should be checked on two screens/ for two screen sizes: Desktop/ wide and mobile/ narrow
The UHR general, qualitative description of valuation criteria is used as a guideline for grading.

Score
Overall 
impression
• Quality of work appropriate for introduction course at bachelor level
• Quantity of work achieved reflects scope of course and size of group
(Group size no more than 5; work should never be less than expected of 3 students)
• All parts of assignment are addressed
• The visual lay-out is well designed
20
HTML is well
structured and 
with correct usage 
of elements
• All meta-elements of HTML 5 and basic structure in place
• HTML is well structured beyond absolute demands by accessibility/ WAI-criteria
• HTML is simple to read and further develop by a different programmer
• Efficient, non-bloated code
15
CSS is wellstructured and 
with correct usage 
of code/ selectors
• Relevant and correct use of selectors
• Styling of elements appropriate and fit-for-purpose
• CSS is simple to read and to develop further by a different programmer
• Efficient (non-bloated) code; if multiple stylesheets are used, they are used well
20
Comments & 
evidence of 
understanding
• Comments in code used to assist other developers/ demonstrate understanding
(important: total lack of meaningful comments influence this score heavily)
• Understanding of code is evident in use, e.g. appropriate use of HTML-tags for 
context, single or double styling of elements are coherent and rational
• Directories are well-structured & paths used correctly
• Names are descriptive
• Naming conventions are consistent
20
Accessibility
• Site follows the guidelines from W3C WAI closely
• Automated checks are used, and the site is consistent with the results
• The design has a high level of legibility and visual contrast
• All pages are easy to navigate and use
15
Technical and 
theoretical insight 
and expertise
• Use of contemporary knowledge, relevant techniques and methods
• Relevance/ appropriateness/ feasibility of code to achieve outcome
• Evidence of creativity and innovative thinking, as per UHR criteria (Note: This is a 
“plus” criteria, an opportunity to show excellence more than a requirement.)
