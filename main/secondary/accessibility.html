            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              When our group was in the process of creating the layout for the
              website for our project we considered a number of issues which
              would help us organize our work consistently and effectively.
              First of all, we made sure to use semantic HTML elements to convey
              the document structure. Semantic elements provide valuable
              information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers,
              helping users with disabilities to understand and navigate the
              content more effectively. Search engines use semantic HTML to
              understand the content and context of a webpage. By using elements
              like "article", "section", and "header", as well as appropirate
              meta tags in the "head" we tried to provide search engines with
              clearer information about the organization of our content,
              potentially improving our page's search engine ranking. We also
              tried adding on a consistent basis descriptive alternative text
              (alt attributes) for images. We are sure that checking the correct
              use of heading tags (h1, h2, etc.), as well as their correct
              order, helped us to create a logical document structure and is
              also a good practice we are glad we incorporated in our work.
              Another issue that was of great concern for our group was the
              responsive design of our website. People access the internet using
              a diverse range of devices, including smartphones, tablets,
              laptops, and desktop computers. Responsive design ensures that our
              website is accessible and usable on more devices, thus
              accommodating users with different preferences and needs. We
              created designs for a desktop and a mobile phone version of the
              website.

          <div class="item">
            <h2>Takeaways... <Contunued class="">Continuation</Contunued></h2>
            <p>
              To test the accessibility of our site, we utilized an automated
              test through Lighthouse. By simply inputting our repository
              through the Lighthouse plug-in, we were able to access the full
              capabilities of the automated test. Our group was very happy with
              the results of the automated test, and we received critical
              feedback on areas we performed well on and areas that we could
              potentially improve. All pages of our website received competitive
              scores of 100, 90, 83, and 83. While the automated test was very
              helpful in getting feedback, we knew it wasn't fully
              representative of how accessible our site actually was. For this
              reason, our group knew that we must take the results with a grain
              of salt, and reflecting on the website's accessibility as a group
              and through outsite input would be more comprehensive.
