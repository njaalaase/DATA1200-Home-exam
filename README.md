# DATA1200-Home-exam

Home exam, assignment text
 

You are expected to do this home exam in groups of 3 to 5 students, as per the "Course descriptionLinks to an external site.".
Create groups on InsperaLinks to an external site.
Upload the site as a Zipped file (minimum)
Optional: Send link to GitHub/ GitHub pages as well
Language: Any Scandinavian language or English
You are expected to use HTML5 & CSS3; no JavaScript (or other languages, libraries or external sources) should be necessary
 

OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:
Create this site in GitHub and publish on GitHub Pages.
Submit a link to the GitHub Pages site as text on Inspera in addition to the Zip-file
 

Create a website with 4 or 5 pages
Theme: OsloMet Campus in general or Pilestredet 35 in particular
index.html should have a general introduction with at least one relevant image
One page must be "Accessibility" — see below
One page must be "Topical" — see below
The remaining (1 or 2) pages should have images and headings presenting a place or an aspect of the campus/ building, e.g. a canteen; the text may be "dummy text" — see below
All pages but one must share the same visual design
You may choose which (if any) one page should have a different design
Comment your code
Any semantic element deserves a super-short comment on what it is
Any CSS selector (in the CSS, not when used in HTML) deserves a comment, at least a descriptor
Any code that is used in scaling or responsive to screen-size deserves a comment
The main purpose for the comments should be to help a future developer take over your project and develop it further; for me, it helps weed out the most obvious copied-code-without-understanding issues
Compulsory pages in site:
Accessibility-page
Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text (about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. Tell us how you checked, and coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an automated test could tell you. You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code – lack of images may affect your score.

Topical-page
Copy a short text (anywhere from 300 to 1000 words) from DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers or other subject you have completed. (Or write a new, short text.)

Add images (if there are none). Remember that in Norwegian copyright law, photographer must always be included. (May be organisation, e.g."Photo: Scanpix", can be in the code, hence invisible on the page itself.)

Add headings (if there are none).

Add links (if there are none). This text should have multiple links to external sites with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

If you wish to show off some skills, but found that difficult with the other pages, you can make this (or another) page different from the others, with a distinct visual of functional identity.

Dummy texts
Apart from the pages "Accessibility" and "Topical", you may use a Lorem-ipsum text. We shall not read the other texts, but we shall look for relevant and correct use of headings, links and <picture>/ <img> with alt-text. This is often easier to do correctly with actual texts than dummy-text. Even in a dummy-text, you should use real headings, like <h1>Study areas in P35</h1>…<h2>The library</h2>.

Copying code
You should always cite in a comment where you have code from, if it is from a particular place. For example:
<!-- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_picture.aspLinks to an external site. --> or /* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/GridsLinks to an external site. */

However, in most circumstances we shall not expect you to cite those two sites, as this is considered "general knowledge". And even if you do reuse code from these sites, you get full score for using the code correctly.

On the other hand, if you use more special code from sites like CodePen.io, you should always cite it. Furthermore, if you use the code as-is, i.e. don't make it your own through modification or application, you may not get any points from it.
/* https://codepen.io/Wandersonsc/pen/RMerRy */ In fact, you may lose points if you copy code without citing it or if you seem to not understand how it should be applied.

Using code suggested by an AI is highly risky! LLM AIs like ChatGPT reuse code from existing sites, but a) may not cite the correct sources, b) sometimes makes mistakes, and c) even when it doesn't make mistakes, it can be a mix-and-match that lacks consistency. Therefor: Don't use AI, please! (GitHub Copilot is better, but not without issues.)

Using images
Always have photographer-name (or company) and source. (Both or any can be visible, both or any can be hidden in a comment.) In Norway, the photo must always be credited. For example inside the text that accompany the imageLinks to an external site..

Illustration photo, with photographer name and rights-holder name in byline.

The size of any photo should never be bigger than 1 MB
